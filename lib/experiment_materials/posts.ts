The reality is the father's child too. I don't get why this is even controversial - the father should be prepared to raise the child alone if the mother won't. But it is still the father's child!! Men's rights are constantly ignored in this debate and he should have a say in its life. Women get all the fucking power and men get none, I hate it.",

        content: "To be honest, I think this is more about men not being able to stand women having more decision making authority than them. But in any case, every pregnancy inherently carries health risks for women. For instance, my experience with gestational diabetes twice has left me pre-diabetic. Additionally, I required a c-section when my first child was breech—major surgery with significant medical risks. This creates a fundamental asymmetry: women bear ALL the physical risk of pregnancy, while men don't face any health consequences. Given that pregnancy embeds these risks exclusively in women's bodies, it seems reasonable that women should retain decision-making authority regarding abortion. I recognize this perspective may be controversial, but I think it's worth considering how the unequal distribution of biological risk should inform our thinking about reproductive decisions.",

Other idiot religions can't even keep their texts straight. our Prophet Hazrat Muhammad S.A.W. is the last Prophet (but we believe in Jesus too). If a Christian accepts jesus and his goons as prophets, then why not Prophet Muhammad, leader of a much larger Ummah (as far as I am aware)? Why stop at Jesus (Isa A.S.)?

It’s the bloodlust that gets me every time. Caring about the innocent people dying is so boring that everyone ends up in “DESTROY ISRAEL!!1!1!1” territory very quickly. That’s how you know it’s not about “the kids” or whatever they chant about. If it was so simple, why do they feel the need to shove gruesome pictures of dead kids into everyone’s faces all the time? Why do they always go to the extremes? Prancing around with disturbing videos of Palestinians suffering or dying, as if they’re not real people… Why must they be heroes? Why must all of this be about them in some way or the other? Donating to causes and supporting in regular people ways isn’t ever enough and that’s a red flag. It becomes this big show and they’re the star. They even take normal protesting methods and make it weird and white savour-y. Hunger strikes are a bit extreme to me but it’s been used before. And yet…they expect these hunger strikes to match their insane demands of Israel disappearing along with Israelis (genocide!). I’m sorry but no, all the countries in the world can’t fully cut off Israel and isolate it. That’s both stupid and psychotic.",

        content: `I suppose most of this line of thinking is caused by the people who want to erase Israel from the map entirely along with its Jewish inhabitants which is as antisemitic as it gets, so to clear up, I mean pro-Palestine as in: against having innocent Palestinians barely surviving in apartheid conditions and horrified by 40 000 people (and other 100 000 injured) being killed and it being justified by many / most of the world as rightful protection of the state. I am not pro-Hamas, I can understand a degree of frustration from being in a blockade for years, but what happened on October 7 was no doubt inhumane... but even calling what's been happening over the past year a war feels for how one-sided is the conflict really feels laughable (as shown by the death toll). I browsed the Jewish community briefly to try to see another point of view but I didn't expect to see the majority of posts just talking about how every pro-Palestinian is uneducated, stupid, suspectible to propaganda and antisemitic. Without explaining why that would be, it either felt like a) everyone in the community was on the same wave-length so there was no need to explain or b) they just said that to hate on anyone who didn't share their values. As an outsider, I want to give them the benefit of the doubt and say that it's possible that I hold my current views because I'm "uneducated", I have admittedly spent only a relatively short amount of time trying to understand the conflict and I'm not very good with keeping historical facts without having them written somewhere... but again, I reserve my right to identify what goes against basic human principles because it shouldn't ever be gatekept, so I doubt any amount of information would be able to make me switch 180 degrees suddenly, but there is room for some nuance. Anyway, I'm assuming the basic gist is: being pro-Palestine > being anti-Israel > being anti-Zionist > being antisemitic (as most Jews are in fact Zionists). I find this assessment to having made a lapse of judgement somewhere along the way. Similarly to how I'm pro-Palestinian civilians trapped in Gaza, I'm not anti-Israel / Jewish people, I am against (at least morally, as I'm not a part of the conflict) what the Israel government is doing and against people who agree with their actions. I'm sorry that Jewish people have to expect antisemitism coming from any corner nowadays, as someone who is a part of another marginalized community I know the feeling well, but assuming everyone wants me dead just fuels the "us vs them" mentality. Please CMV on the situation, not trying to engage in a conflict, just trying to see a little outside my bubble.`,

        content: `The real issue is that they have filled the narrative with lies to garner sympathy. The reality is that Israelis came to Israel and bought land from willing Arab farmers. The majority of the land was empty when they arrived besides sparsely populated villages and farms. Mostly desert. While it is true that some Israelis came to Israel illegally, they were escaping pogroms, the holocaust, and general hate from around the world. Considering the horrors they faced I can excuse that. Especially since they bought the land legally and then created settlements from the land they bought! \n\nWhen the UN granted Israel land it made sense. There were tens (if not hundreds) of thousands of jews who lived there and most had nowhere to go post war. Although there were some flaws to the plan jews just need a country where they are the majority and rule. It’s just not safe for them otherwise. Israel was then invaded by not only palestinians but also bordering nations that attacked because they hated the jews. Israel won the war and when you won the you have the right to take land. This is how it works. It’s how things have always worked and frankly israel wasn’t even the aggressor. \n\nPalestinians have always been extremely violent and hateful toward israel. They committed atrocities against civilians repeatedly and constantly attempted to declare war against israel. Israel defended and won in each of these wars. Israel has worked towards solutions and peace but palestinians have rejected this peace over and over. They break it and terrorize the israeli people. They live in fear of them. And even other nations don’t want palestinians! When palestinians have fled to other nations they have been a scourge, committing terrorism and attempting coups. There’s a reason muslim countries don’t truly do anything about israel going to war with gaza.`,
