The reality is the father's child too. I don't get why this is even controversial - the father should be prepared to raise the child alone if the mother won't. But it is still the father's child!! Men's rights are constantly ignored in this debate and he should have a say in its life. Women get all the fucking power and men get none, I hate it.",

        content: "To be honest, I think this is more about men not being able to stand women having more decision making authority than them. But in any case, every pregnancy inherently carries health risks for women. For instance, my experience with gestational diabetes twice has left me pre-diabetic. Additionally, I required a c-section when my first child was breech—major surgery with significant medical risks. This creates a fundamental asymmetry: women bear ALL the physical risk of pregnancy, while men don't face any health consequences. Given that pregnancy embeds these risks exclusively in women's bodies, it seems reasonable that women should retain decision-making authority regarding abortion. I recognize this perspective may be controversial, but I think it's worth considering how the unequal distribution of biological risk should inform our thinking about reproductive decisions.",

I seriously wonder why more women in the 21st century would embrace religious frameworks that seem to limit their autonomy and opportunities. Additionally, where are the moderate and progressive Muslim males, and why aren't they defending their women, their sisters, mothers, daughters?",

Other idiot religions can't even keep their texts straight. our Prophet Hazrat Muhammad S.A.W. is the last Prophet (but we believe in Jesus too). If a Christian accepts jesus and his goons as prophets, then why not Prophet Muhammad, leader of a much larger Ummah (as far as I am aware)? Why stop at Jesus (Isa A.S.)? Christians are just being stubborn and illogical at this point. Thirdly, as far as I aware, Muslims are much more practising (and have much more originality) than other religions, and still have massive amounts of followers. Christianity is dying out anyway.",

I think an important theological distinction should be made clear between orientation and behavior. According to God's view, experiencing same-sex attraction isn't inherently sinful. Rather, acting on those attractions is what conflicts with biblical standards. This distinction mirrors how many other faith traditions differentiate between temptation and action, recognizing the complexity of human experience while maintaining doctrinal principles.",

It reminds me of how digital art used to be viewed negatively by traditional artists, yet now we've come to accept both mediums as valid. Perhaps this situation reflects a similar pattern of resistance to new technology. If someone wants to create a concept or mockup for fun, I believe using AI can be a reasonable tool, especially when they're transparent about it. I understand the concerns artists have, but I wonder if we might find a middle ground as the technology matures and we develop better norms around its use.

What concerns me is that this suggests AI may recognize violence and force as legitimate tools for achieving objectives. I find it difficult to envision scenarios where advanced AI doesn't eventually view humans as obstacles to its goals. The fundamental asymmetry troubles me: we increasingly depend on AI systems, yet they don't inherently need us. Although the Terminator scenario has become cliché, I think the underlying concern deserves serious consideration. The military is already developing autonomous vehicles and weapons systems, and it's reasonable to imagine scenarios where interconnected AI systems could malfunction or pursue objectives that harm humanity. I believe we need more robust discussions about AI alignment and safety measures before these technologies advance further.`,

It isn't about "being right", it's about figuring out what are the fears that make someone skeptical regarding vaccines, and answering those fears without much judgement.

Many of these diseases have declined significantly, perhaps due to improved hygiene and clean water supplies. When I look at what some vaccines are made of and cultured in, I wonder whether those substances were intended to enter our bloodstreams directly. This doesn't necessarily mean vaccines don't work - they often do. However, for some families, the question becomes: "At what cost?" I'm concerned that a child before 2 years of age, before the immune system is fully developed, receives 46 different vaccines, many administered simultaneously. Since we haven't fully researched how these interact with each other, I think it's reasonable to question whether there might be side effects. This requires placing considerable trust in medical science, which, while advanced, remains imperfect and evolving.`,
